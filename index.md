## Welcome to CppConfs!

The number of C++ conferences has lately been increasing almost as fast as the number of language features. Which is a great thing ;)
Unlike academic conferences, C++ conferences are happy to feature talks that have been previously given elsewhere. This allows speakers to interact with a larger crowd, and allows smaller conferences to get a hold of top notch speakers. The purpose of this list is to help people - speakers and not - be aware of conferences of interest, and be able to plan ahead.

The goal of this list is to provide the basic details of each listed conference, and provide some historic perspective. Since some of the details are not public, if you have some missing detail, feel free to contribute it. That includes unlisted conferences, of course.
